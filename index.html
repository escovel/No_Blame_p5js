      <p><em>No Blame</em> is an amorphous digital book of poetry and art, with text by Tyler Carter and coding/artwork by Eric Goddard-Scovel. It consists of 64 pages, with 48 poems (i.e., 16 static original poems and 32 poems shuffled by algorithms partially derived from the casting of <em>I Ching</em> hexagrams) and 16 works of generative art.</p>
      <p>We call it an "amorphous" digital book because it presents a unique outcome each time the program runs. Just as a hexagram of the <em>I Ching</em> is cast when the <em>I Ching</em> is used as a method of divination, the content of <em>No Blame</em> is cast with every generation so that the lines of 32 of its poems are shuffled into new arrangements, the 16 artworks are generated in new variations, and each poem and artwork is associated with a new hexagram. This casting is not simply random but is instead an outcome of the algorithms of the <em>I Ching</em> and an algorithm derived for this project.</p>
