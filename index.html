      <p>This web application, programmed by Eric Goddard-Scovel using the p5.js framework, generates an “amorphous” digital book consisting of 64 pages, with 48 poems (3 16-poem sequences) and 16 works of generative art (still in development). All of the poems are derived from original poems written by Tyler Carter. The book is to be both displayed on the web and offered to the reader to download as a PDF (also still in progress).</p>
      <p>Additionally, the book’s 64 pages are titled and arranged by the 64 hexagrams of the ancient Chinese book of divination, the <em>I Ching</em> (or <em>Book of Changes</em>). As each poem or page of artwork is generated and/or placed into the preliminary sequence of the book, it is assigned a hexagram via a three-coin method, or coin oracle, which is the most common contemporary method of casting the <em>I Ching</em>. The <a href="https://divination.com/how-to-consult-the-i-ching/" target="_blank">"How to Consult the I Ching"</a> page at the Divination Foundation covers the basics of this method. For further study, we highly recommend (for English readers) the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/534289.The_I_Ching_or_Book_of_Changes" target="_blank">Wilhelm/Baynes translation of the <em>I Ching</em></a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/78341.Understanding_the_I_Ching" target="_blank"><em>Understanding the I Ching: The Wilhelm Lectures on the Book of Changes</em></a>, and Eliot Weinberger's article <a href="http://www.chinafile.com/library/nyrb-china-archive/what-i-ching" target="_blank">"What Is the I Ching?"</a></p>
